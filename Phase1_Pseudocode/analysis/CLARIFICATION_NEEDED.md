# üéØ Clarification Needed - Completing Requirements

Based on your responses so far, I need clarification on a few items to complete the requirements analysis:

---

## ‚úÖ What I Understand So Far

1. **Dynamic Subject Focus**: You want flexibility to choose focus subjects dynamically
2. **Current Priority**: Language learning (Korean/Chinese) + AI programming
3. **Study Activities**: "All of the above" for each subject type
4. **Process Flowchart System**: AI-generated visual flowcharts from clarifying questions
5. **Reminders**: 3 per day with urgent emojis
6. **Morning Summary**: You want all components (ranked equally)
7. **Habit Formation**: 60 days to "second nature" but continue tracking
8. **Progression**: Automatic increases (e.g., flashcards 10‚Üí15)

## üîç Still Need Answers For:

### 1. Reminder Timing
You said "3 reminders throughout the day" - what times work best?
- Morning reminder: [0930]
- Midday reminder: [1500]  
- Evening reminder: [1900]

### 2. Flashcard Progression Details
You mentioned "after x days increase from 10-15" - what should x be?
- Days before first increase: ___
- Increase rate: 5 cards every 14 days
- Maximum daily cards: ___

### 3. Pattern Recognition (Question 3)
You said "refer to system prompts" - which specific patterns from the AI prompts are most important to you? Please rank 1-5:
- Recurring themes: 
      AI-assisted daily reflection (Epiphany row)

      At the end of each day, an automated reviewer (AI) MUST:

      1. Open the current day's journal file.
      2. Parse the **Reflections** section.
      3. Append a new section **"Epiphany"** that contains:
         - **Patterns Observed:** Concise summary of recurring themes or hidden messages.
         - **Actionable To-Do:** Bullet list of systems, processes, or tasks inferred from the reflections.

- Time productivity: create for this
- Subject switching: create for this
- Energy patterns: create for this
- Procrastination: create for this
- Success patterns: create for this

### 4. Gamification (Question 9)
This was cut off. Please complete:
- Favorite progression systems from other apps: 
- Achievement visibility (private/public):
- Streak break handling:
- Preferred rewards: Come up with something, but what ever it is ensure that it makes the learning process addicting

### 5. Critical Missing Info:
- **Google Calendar**: Which calendars to sync? 
      Allow the user to choose
- **Subject-specific features**: Any unique needs for Korean vs Chinese vs Finance? 
      language allows me to understand people and there cultures, finance allows me to make more money and understand how finances control the underlying reality of life. 
- **Success metrics**: What does daily/weekly/monthly success look like? 
      95% dompletion of all goals, especially top prioty goals 
- **Failure recovery**: How to handle missed days? 
      bump over to the next day
- **Dream feature**: What one feature would make this perfect? 
      Organization but deeply feature rich and user friednly. I want this to be an all in one second brain
- **Biggest concern**: What could make you stop using the system?
      Not organized, to complicated, and lack a dopamine driver

## üìä Quick Questions (Yes/No)

Please answer Y or N:
- y Should the system automatically pause subjects you haven't touched in 7 days?

      I just want to race against myself
- [ y] Should AI suggest when to switch subjects based on fatigue?
- [ y] Do you want export capabilities for your learning data?
- [y ] Should the system integrate with Anki for flashcards?
      If possible, to recieve study hours

## üéØ Process Flowchart System

For your flowchart generation idea, please clarify:

1. **Trigger**: When should the system generate a flowchart?
         When the user has completed the process defining qestionaire 

2. **Input Method**: How do you want to provide the clarifying questions?
      The most effective and iffecient method, either notion template/ database entry, or through the use of a questionare  

3. **Use Cases**: What processes do you most want to visualize?
   - Study routines? Yes
   - Decision trees? How to get from point a to destination repeadedly through the replication of the same actions
   - Progress paths? yes
