Responses:  
1. I would like the notion dashboard to have the ability to give the user the chance to choose what subject they would like to focus on dynamically, but at the moment I am currently focus on language learning, and utilizing and creating things (programs) with AI has been a byproduct of that.  which has been taking up majority of my time. 

2. All of the above

3. refer to system prompts

4. I would like to create a dashboard that contains clarifying question to identify how the system, or identified process should work and upon input gets reviewed by AI and which the reviewed output then gets review again by ai to generate a svg/ jpg flowcart which is transformed into an image and saved within our notion database for the user to review and save for personal use. 

5. 3 reminders through out the day are ideal, ensuring that the use of emojis creates an urgent feeling 

6. All of the above

7. after 60 consecutive days, but streaks should still be tracked

8. Track progression to mastery, for example after x days increase flashcard count from 10-15 

9.
