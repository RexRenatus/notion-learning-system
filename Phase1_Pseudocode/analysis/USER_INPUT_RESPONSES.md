Response: 
1. The workflow for the todoist comments was really me typing random thought or things that I wanted to remember through the day in the comment section. Sometimes it would just be things that I was working on and needed a place to store the information, or sometimes it would be random reflection thoughts, that I want to keep so I can later identify why I was thinking it and to see if there was a pattern that I was missing/ over looking from my thoughts. 

2.Currently I track time based on subtask such as studying flashcards, reading, writing. I would like to identify my study patterns and see what areas I can improve on daily in small increments to where I am building a foundation. 

3. I extracted all of my comments, thoughts, notes, and I pasted them into a file for it to be analyzed and to identify those underlying patters, or to keep track of overlook todo items that I have not completed but I know it still needs to be completed. Lets create a prompt file, so we can save prompts in one location, to give us more context on what exactly i am looking for. 

4. I am currently learning Korean and Chinese. With a plan on adding Spanish, and Japanese to the mix. I want to also add philosphophy, grammar, logic, art , six sigma (green, yellow, black), CFA 1-3, FRM 1-2, CPA, CAIA,CPWA into the mix. I want to not only master langaunge and social arts, but finance as well. 

5. A daily task become actionable to me when it can be completed repeadtedly overtime, to the point that the task then becomes second nature. I have observed that habits are things that creates a persons character. Which is why I also want to create a system/ processes pipeline, which identifies process and utilize AI llm to create visual diagrams which ensures I am able to follow the same plan repeatedly inorder to get the same results always. This is because I know i am what i do everyday. 

6. ALl of the above

7. All of the above

8. I prefer feature rich interfaces which are simple and super easy to use for the user, but the backend is super powerful

9.I would like to receive notification throught the day as reminders to complete a task via telegram. Also for summarizations, I would like to receive them around 0600 the following today, so that I can reflect on what i need to accomplish for that day. I would like for the summarizations to be as detailed as possible (review prompt for more informations) 

10. No

11. I would also like to implement a google calendar updater, ect so that we can keep track of goals, and to ensure that our daily sitrep through telegrams includes things that will happen during the daily that I should focus on .
