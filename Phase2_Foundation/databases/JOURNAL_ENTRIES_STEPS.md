2. Name: "📝 Daily Journal"
3. Set these property values:
   ```
   Date: Today
   Mood: 😐 Neutral
   AI Analysis Complete: Unchecked
   Summary Sent: Unchecked
   ```
4. **Click into the main page area** (below all the properties)
5. Add this page structure:

```markdown

## 🎨 Configure Database View for Full-Page Journaling

### Recommended View Setup
1. **Change to Gallery View**:
   - Click view dropdown → "+ Add a view"
   - Select "Gallery" 
   - Name it "Journal Entries"
   
2. **Configure Gallery Cards**:
   - Card preview: Entry Title
   - Card size: Medium
   - Properties to show: Date, Mood, Total Time Today
   - Hide other properties for cleaner look

3. **Create Filtered Views**:
   - "Today's Entry": Filter where Date = Today
   - "This Week": Filter where Date = This week
   - "Weekly Reviews": Filter where Entry Title contains "Weekly"

4. **Sort Order**:
   - Sort by Date → Descending (newest first)

### Why Gallery View?
- Each card represents a journal entry
- Click to open full page for writing
- Visual preview of mood and date
- Easy to see your journal history

---

## 🧪 Test Your Database

### Create Test Journal Entry
1. Use "📝 Daily Journal" template
2. Fill in:
   - **Date**: Today
   - **Tasks Completed**: "Completed Korean flashcards, Read 2 chapters"
   - **Random Thoughts**: "Need to focus more on speaking practice"
   - **Todo Tomorrow**: "[ ] Review grammar rules\n[ ] 30 min conversation practice"
   - **Mood**: 👍 Focused
   - **Sessions Today**: Link to any sessions from today

### Verify These Work:
- [ ] Entry Title shows as "2025-01-05 Journal" format
- [ ] Can link multiple sessions
- [ ] Date field prevents duplicate dates
- [ ] All text fields accept multi-line input

---

## 🎯 Important Setup Notes

### Make Date Field Unique
1. This ensures only ONE journal entry per day
2. Notion doesn't have a "unique" constraint, so you'll need to:
   - Check manually before creating entries
   - Or use a filtered view to show "Today" only

### Daily Workflow
1. Create one journal entry at end of day
2. Link all learning sessions from that day
3. Fill in reflections and thoughts
4. AI will process overnight (when integrated)
5. Review AI insights next morning

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

Before considering complete:
- [ ] All 18 properties created
- [ ] Entry Title set as display title
- [ ] Can link to Daily Learning Sessions
- [ ] Templates created with placeholder text
- [ ] Test entry created successfully
- [ ] Rollups will be added after testing relations

---

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Multiple Entries for Same Date
- Notion doesn't enforce uniqueness
- Create a filtered view: Date = Today
- Manual discipline: One entry per day

### Rollups Showing 0
- This is expected until you link sessions
- We'll convert after you have test data
- Alternative: Keep as formulas if rollups give issues

### Long Text Fields
- Use Shift+Enter for line breaks
- Consider using headers (##) for organization
- Text fields have no length limit

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **End of day routine**: Create entry before bed
2. **Link sessions immediately** after creating entry
3. **Be honest** in reflections - this feeds AI insights
4. **Use templates** for consistency
5. **Review previous entries** for patterns

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. Create a few days of test entries
2. Link them to learning sessions
3. Convert formula properties to rollups
4. Test the aggregation features
5. Set up daily reminder to create journal

---

**Note**: This is where the magic happens - AI will analyze these entries to find patterns and generate insights!
