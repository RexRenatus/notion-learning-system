# üìä Progress Calculation Formulas

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: How to Enter Formulas
**DO NOT COPY-PASTE!** You must manually select properties from the dropdown in Notion's formula editor.  
**See `HOW_TO_ADD_FORMULAS.md` for detailed instructions!**

## Overview
Advanced formulas to automatically calculate progress across goals, subjects, and daily activities.

## üìå Important Notion Limitations
- **Cannot access properties of related items in formulas** (e.g., can't get Session Date from Learning Sessions)
- **Cannot filter rollups by date** in formulas
- **Solution**: Use rollups for aggregations, formulas for calculations on direct properties

**Purpose**: Count how many linked actions are marked complete

```
length(
  filter(

```

**Note**: This requires Actions relation to be set up

### 2. Total Actions Count (New Property)

**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Count total number of linked actions

```
length(prop("Actions"))
```

### 3. Progress Percentage (Update Existing)

**Purpose**: Calculate completion percentage

```
if(
  prop("Total Actions") > 0,
  round(prop("Actions Completed") / prop("Total Actions") * 100),
  0
)
```

### 4. Status Auto-Update (New Property)
**Property Name**: Auto Status

  prop("Progress %") == 100,
  "‚úÖ Completed",
  if(
    prop("Target Date") < now(),
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Overdue",
    if(
      prop("Progress %") > 0,

  )
)
```

### 5. Days Remaining (New Property)
**Property Name**: Days Left  
**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Show days until target date

```
if(
  prop("Target Date") > now(),
  dateBetween(prop("Target Date"), now(), "days"),
  0
)
```

### 6. On Track Status (New Property)
**Property Name**: On Track  
**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Are you on pace to complete by deadline?

```
if(
  prop("Goal Type") == "Yearly",
  if(
    prop("Progress %") >= (dateBetween(now(), dateSubtract(prop("Target Date"), 365, "days"), "days") / 365 * 100),
    "‚úÖ On Track",

## üìö Subject Master - Progress Formulas

### 1. Active Sessions Count (New Property)
**Property Name**: Total Sessions

Calculate: Count all
```

### 2. Time This Week (New Property)
**Property Name**: Time This Week (min)  
**Type**: Rollup  
**Purpose**: Total minutes studied (all time for now)

```
Relation: Learning Sessions
Property: Duration
Calculate: Sum
```

**Note**: Notion can't filter rollups by date in formulas. To get "this week" data, you'll need to create a filtered view or use the API.

### 3. Weekly Goal Progress (New Property)
**Property Name**: Weekly Progress %  
**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Progress toward weekly time goal

**Prerequisites**: 
- Must have "Weekly Time Goal" property (Number, in minutes)

```
if(
  prop("Weekly Time Goal") > 0,
  round(prop("Time This Week (min)") / prop("Weekly Time Goal") * 100),
  0
)
```

**Note**: Since we can't filter by "this week", this shows progress toward your weekly goal based on ALL TIME. For true weekly tracking, manually reset or use views.

### 4. Last Session Date (New Property)
**Property Name**: Last Session Date  
**Type**: Rollup  
**Purpose**: Track most recent session

```
Relation: Learning Sessions
Property: Session Date
Calculate: Latest date

### 5. Days Since Last Session (New Property)
**Property Name**: Days Since Last  
**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Calculate days since last study session

```
if(
  empty(prop("Last Session Date")),
  999,
  dateBetween(now(), prop("Last Session Date"), "days")
)
```

### 6. Study Status (New Property)
**Property Name**: Study Status  
**Type**: Formula

    prop("Days Since Last") == 1,
    "‚úÖ Yesterday",
    if(
      prop("Days Since Last") <= 3,
      "‚ö†Ô∏è " + format(prop("Days Since Last")) + " days ago",
      "‚ùå Inactive"
    )
  )
)
```

### 7. Momentum Score (New Property)
**Property Name**: Momentum  
**Type**: Formula  
**Purpose**: Simple momentum indicator

```
round(
  if(prop("Days Since Last") == 0, 50, 0) +
  if(prop("Days Since Last") <= 1, 30, 0) +
  if(prop("Total Sessions") > 10, 20, 0)
)
```

**Purpose**: Points per minute - efficiency metric

```
if(
  prop("Estimated Time") > 0,

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Implement one formula at a time
2. **Test Edge Cases**: What happens with 0 values?
3. **Performance**: Complex formulas may slow large databases
4. **Iterate**: Adjust scoring weights based on your needs
