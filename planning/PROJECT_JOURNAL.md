## üîë Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Pseudocode-First Development
**Decision**: Complete all design before Notion implementation
**Rationale**: Prevents costly rework, forces clear thinking
**Result**: Comprehensive documentation created naturally

### 2. Modular Database Architecture
**Decision**: 10 separate databases vs monolithic design
**Rationale**: Single responsibility, easier maintenance
**Trade-off**: More complex relations but better scalability

### 3. AI Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Use Zapier + LLM APIs for automation
**Rationale**: No-code solution, reliable, modifiable
**Alternative Considered**: Custom scripts (rejected for complexity)

### 4. Gamification Approach
**Decision**: XP-based with streak multipliers, no punishment
**Rationale**: Familiar system, positive reinforcement only
**Innovation**: Dopamine-driven design principles

### 5. Process Documentation
**Decision**: AI-generated flowcharts from questionnaires
**Rationale**: Captures tacit knowledge visually
**Unique Value**: Builds library of personal SOPs
